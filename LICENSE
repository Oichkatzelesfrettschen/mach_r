Mach_R is an independent implementation written in Rust, using the published
Mach architecture documentation and research papers as reference. No original
CMU Mach source code has been directly copied or translated into this project.

Historical CMU Mach source code is archived in the archive/ directory for
research and reference purposes only, and remains under its original CMU
license. This archived code is not part of the Mach_R implementation.
